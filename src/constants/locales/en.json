      "a1": "Next.js makes React application development more convenient by providing various features such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file-based routing, API routes, and image optimization.",
      "q2": "Why use TypeScript?",
      "a2": "TypeScript improves code stability through a static type system and helps detect errors during development. It also enhances development productivity through IDE auto-completion features and helps with code documentation.",
      "q3": "Why was React Query created?",
      "a3": "React Query was created to solve the complexity of server state management. It simplifies API call-related state management by providing features such as caching, background updates, and data synchronization.",
      "q4": "How do Type and Interface differ?",
      "a4": "Type and Interface are two ways to define types in TypeScript. Interface is good for extensibility and allows declaration merging, while Type allows for more diverse type expressions such as union types and intersection types.",
      "q5": "When and how should you specify types for useState?",
      "a5": "You should explicitly specify types for useState using generics when type inference from the initial value is not sufficient. This is particularly useful for states that include null or undefined, or complex object types."

This path was driven by my passion for people and logic. This journey has led to my current ability to develop intuitive and efficient frontend solutions based on a deep understanding of user interfaces and experiences. Frontend development, where I can solve problems with technology at the closest point to users, is the field where I can best express my passion and capabilities."

      "q2": "How do you approach responsive design?",
      "a2": "I use a mobile-first approach with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS. I ensure that interfaces work well on all device sizes by using responsive design principles, flexible layouts, and thorough testing.",
      "q3": "Do you have experience with state management?",
      "a3": "Yes, I have extensive experience with various state management solutions including React Context API, Redux, Zustand, and React Query for server state. I choose the appropriate solution based on project requirements.",
      "q4": "How do you ensure code quality?",
      "a4": "I maintain code quality through comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and E2E), code reviews, static type checking with TypeScript, linting, and following best practices for performance and accessibility.",
      "q5": "Can you work with design systems?",
      "a5": "Yes, I have experience implementing and maintaining design systems. I understand the importance of consistent UI components and can work with designers to translate their vision into reusable code components."
