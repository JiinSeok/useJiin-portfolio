  "introduction": "I am Jiin Seok, a frontend developer who creates reliable technical assets through clear collaboration, keen insight, and adaptability in problem solving.<br><br>With two years of experience as a QA engineer in IT startups, I standardized processes to deliver reliable products on time.<br><br>I contributed to the integration of frontend components by developing design systems for inputs and dropdowns, which significantly reduced related inquiries. Previously, inputs and dropdowns were inconsistently developed by different developers, resulting in slight visual variations and various bugs. To resolve this, I defined standard UI elements and detailed their specifications and state-based designs using spreadsheets. Component integration improved the user experience, reduced user errors, and allowed support teams to focus on strategic initiatives such as creating user training resources.<br><br>Standardization also proved invaluable in team project development.<br><br>By implementing a common error handler, I streamlined API function development. In real production environments, refactoring inconsistent error messages took a lot of time. To address this, I created a common error handler during a team project that automatically sets default messages based on HTTP status codes. Using Tanstack React Query’s API request management templating feature, I applied this handler to all API requests, reducing development time compared to previous implementations. Custom messages were easy to add, making error handling more efficient.<br><br>I have continually challenged myself to establish standards that cover all stages, from planning to development and usage. Along the way, I’ve learned that standards are more than just criteria for passing tests—they build trust and enable teams to focus on high-impact work. As a developer, I’ve seen firsthand how adopting standards ensures consistent results, delivers desired outcomes, and reduces overall development costs.<br><br>Leveraging my diverse experiences, I’m dedicated to developing scalable and impactful technical assets that make a lasting difference for your organization."
